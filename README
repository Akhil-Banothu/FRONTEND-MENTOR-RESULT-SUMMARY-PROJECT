## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

When building this project I learned how to use "flex" and "grid" properties. I was able to learn when to use the opacity for the colors and background-colors. Everything is so good beginner friendly.

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on improving mobile design on how each content should appear while in mobile view.

As well as want to improve more in styling properties, and code reduction.
